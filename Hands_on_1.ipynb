            "This document provides a comprehensive overview of Generative AI, synthesizing foundational concepts, technological underpinnings, and practical applications as outlined in the course materials from PES University. Generative AI represents a transformative subset of Artificial Intelligence focused on creating novel content, a capability primarily driven by the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). The evolution of these models, from early rule-based systems to the sophisticated, multi-billion parameter architectures of today like GPT-4, is rooted in the development of the Transformer architecture in 2017. This architecture, with its revolutionary \"attention mechanism,\" enables models to understand context and long-range dependencies in data with unprecedented accuracy.\n",

The functionality of these models relies on core principles of Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as converting text into numerical vectors via word embeddings and understanding grammatical structure through Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging and Named Entity Recognition (NER).\n",

            "\n",
            "Generative AI models work by learning the patterns and structures of their training data and then using that knowledge to generate new content. When generating text, an LLM takes an input sequence of words (tokens) and predicts the next most probable word. This process is repeated, with each newly generated word becoming part of the input for predicting the next, allowing the model to produce coherent sentences, paragraphs, and even entire documents.\n",
            "\n",
            "A key challenge in this process is \"Hallucinations\"—instances where the model's output is nonsensical, factually incorrect, or disconnected from the input prompt. This occurs because the model is generating content based on statistical probabilities rather than true understanding or knowledge. This underscores the importance of critically evaluating all AI-generated output.\n",

            "1. Architecture Size: These models have an enormous number of internal parameters, which are like the knobs and switches the model tunes during training. Popular models like GPT-3 have hundreds of billions of parameters.\n",
            "2. Training Data: They are trained on vast amounts of text and other data, allowing them to capture incredibly complex patterns in language and the world.\n",
            "\n",
            "The growth of LLMs has been explosive, particularly since the introduction of the Transformer architecture. The number of parameters in state-of-the-art models has grown exponentially, from millions to hundreds of billions and even trillions. This scaling has been a primary driver of their increased capabilities.\n",
